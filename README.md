# IST618 Information Policy
## Course Description
Public policy issues that affect the information, library, and telecommunication sectors. These include privacy and security, intellectual property, freedom of expression, communications access, and public-sector information. Application of economic, legal, and political science concepts to policy analysis.

This course addresses policy issues that arise with the development of information and communication technologies (ICTs) that form practices in the information society. The company, agency, or non-profit organization where you are working/will work after completing this degree does not operate in isolation. Societal and policy factors influence the decisions that managers make, and you may have an opportunity to participate in these decisions. The foundation of this course is an integrated understanding of information policy, drawing on perspectives from fields such as management, communications, information science, economics, political science, and law. We will use theory and examples from different academic and practitioner sources that present explanations of the problems that we will discuss in class. These resources are important because they give us a base from which our discussion can start. They also give us the opportunity to disagree and develop our own explanations. The examples will help illustrate the problems policy makers face when dealing with issues arising from the development and use of ICTs. Discussions and assignments are enhanced by bringing in viewpoints from readings and research of your own that go beyond the required readings.
